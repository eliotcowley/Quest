# Quest (working title)

Quest is a rhythm-based auto-runner, but instead of only one path like in most auto-runners, there are three, and you have the option to switch between any of them at any time.

You control two characters running in single-file: there is the boy who has a sword which can kill enemies, and the girl who can use magic to get rid of obstacles, among other things. You can only use the ability of the person in front, so you have to switch who’s in front in order to use their ability. Since it’s a rhythm game, you have to time your actions to the background music in order to succeed.

This is a prototype; I have only a couple proof-of-concept levels. However, at some point I’d like to turn it into a full game.
