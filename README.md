# Quest (working title)

This is the repository for Quest (working title), the 2D rhythm-based auto-runner game that I'm making with Unity.

## Download tools

I'm making this with Unity 5.5.0f3. Download it from [the archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive?_ga=1.189596971.1204694424.1471672414).

I'm also using [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48146) and the Unity Tools extension. You can download the extension when you install Unity or Visual Studio.

## Using Git

If you want to contribute to this project, best practice is:

* Make sure your local clone is up-to-date by pulling any changes from master
* Make your own branch off of master called "<your name>-<feature>"
* When you're ready to commit your changes, try a pull request to make sure that there are no merge conflicts
* To avoid merge conflicts, either only work on it when no one else is, or only commit the files you actually changed (for example, scripts and their associated meta files)
